 <h2>
What is Docker and why I used it instead of directly installing nginx on host?
  </h2>

<p>
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.

A container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. 

By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies, differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away.

In addition, Docker has been designed in a way that it can be incorporated into most DevOps applications, including Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, and Ansible, or it can be used on its own to manage development environments. Benefits of using docker:

More efficient use of system resources

Speed

Faster software delivery cycles

Application portability

Makes implementing microservices architecture easier
